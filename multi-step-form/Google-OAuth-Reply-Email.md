**Email Content:**

Dear Google Developer Team,

Thank you for your patience and detailed feedback regarding our OAuth verification submission for project **1008202205794** (Project ID: supabase-writer).

I understand that our previous demo video did not sufficiently demonstrate the functionality of our application. I have created a new comprehensive demo video that addresses all the requirements you specified:

## Updated Demo Video: [VIDEO_URL_HERE]

### What the new video demonstrates:

**1. Complete OAuth Flow with English Consent Screen**
- Full end-to-end user authentication process
- OAuth consent screen displayed in English (language setting visible in bottom-left corner)
- All three requested scopes clearly visible and explained:
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` - Access user's Google Drive to find survey forms
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms.body.readonly` - Read form structure for content validation and safety checks
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms.responses.readonly` - Access form responses for data integration when needed

**2. Practical Scope Usage Demonstration**
- **Drive API**: Live demonstration of searching and retrieving Google Forms from user's Drive
- **Forms API**: Real-time extraction of form structure, title, and accurate question counting
- **Data Integration**: How the imported data flows through our survey distribution platform

**3. Application Context & Purpose**
Our application "Jakpat for Universities" helps academic institutions distribute surveys to our qualified respondent network. The OAuth integration serves these legitimate educational purposes:

- **Content Validation**: We need to read form structure to ensure surveys are appropriate for our respondents
- **Administrative Safety**: Accurate question counting helps us screen content and protect respondents from inappropriate or suspicious surveys
- **Quality Control**: Form data validation before distribution to maintain platform integrity

**4. Security & Privacy**
- All requested permissions are read-only to protect user data
- Form data remains secure within Google's ecosystem
- Integration serves legitimate business purpose of survey distribution with respondent safety measures

The video includes professional voice narration explaining each step of the integration process, highlighting exactly how each OAuth scope is utilized within our platform's survey distribution workflow.

I believe this updated video fully addresses the demo requirements outlined in your verification guidelines. The demonstration clearly shows our application's legitimate educational purpose and responsible use of the requested OAuth scopes.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification regarding our OAuth integration.
