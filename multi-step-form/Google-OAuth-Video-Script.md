**üé§ Narration** (Fast-paced but clear):
> "This is Jakpat for Universities - our platform helps universities distribute their surveys to our qualified respondent network. When users import Google Forms for distribution, they authenticate via OAuth. Here's the consent screen showing our three required scopes: 'drive.readonly' to access their Google Drive, 'forms.body.readonly' to read form structure for safety validation, and 'forms.responses.readonly' for response data if needed. Notice the English language setting. I'll click Allow."

### **SCENE 2: Scope Usage Demonstration** *(1:00 - 2:15)*

- Select a form ‚Üí Show Forms API extracting structure and question count
- Display auto-filled read-only fields with imported data
- Show final accurate question count vs manual counting

**üé§ Narration** (Continuous, explaining each API call):
> "Now watch each scope in action. First, 'drive.readonly' - clicking Search retrieves the university's Google Forms from their Drive, showing survey names and IDs. Next, 'forms.body.readonly' - selecting this survey uses Forms API to extract complete structure, providing precise question counts for our administrative safety checks. We filter out non-questions like headers and images to ensure accurate content validation before distributing to our respondent network. This imported data auto-fills our distribution form, protecting our respondents from inappropriate content."
