**Jakpat for Universities is a survey distribution platform that helps universities distribute their surveys to our network of 2 million qualified respondents.**

**FORMS SCOPES USAGE:**

**• forms.body.readonly:** We read the structure of university Google Forms (questions, types, options) to perform content validation and safety screening before distributing to our respondent network. This ensures our respondents receive appropriate academic surveys and aren't exposed to inappropriate, suspicious, or unsafe content.

**• forms.responses.readonly:** We access form metadata and configuration settings (NOT individual responses) to validate survey setup, ensure proper accessibility compliance, and verify form compatibility with our distribution platform's quality standards.

**DRIVE SCOPE USAGE:**

**• drive.readonly:** Universities need to import their existing Google Forms from their institutional Google Drive accounts into our distribution platform. We scan their Drive to locate survey forms that need to be distributed to respondents.

**These scopes enable universities to safely distribute their surveys through our qualified respondent network while maintaining content safety standards and protecting both researchers and respondents. Our platform serves as a secure intermediary that validates survey content before distribution to ensure academic integrity and respondent safety.**
